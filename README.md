# E-Commerce_Customer_Interaction_Dashboard

Project Overview

This project analyzes an E-commerce Customer Behavior Dataset using Power BI to derive actionable insights. The dataset includes customer activity, purchase behavior, and transaction data. The objective is to clean and transform the data, create interactive visualizations, and provide business recommendations to enhance decision-making.

Key Findings from the Dashboard

1. Overall Sales & Customer Engagement

Total Sales: The dashboard indicates total sales of 0.38M (380,000), which is a key performance metric.

Device Types Used: Three device types (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) contribute to sales, with relatively balanced sales across them.

Time Spent & Sales Correlation:

The line chart for sales by time spent shows fluctuations, with peaks around 1.6K to 1.7K transactions at specific points.

Engagement increases sales, suggesting that longer time spent correlates with higher sales.

2. Sales Distribution by Geography

Map Visualization:

Sales are spread across multiple continents, including North America, Europe, and parts of Asia & Africa.

Higher concentration in certain locations, indicating key revenue-generating regions.

3. Sales by Device Type & Payment Method

Device Type Contribution:

Desktop & Tablet contribute 0.13M each, while Mobile generates 0.12M in sales.

This suggests cross-device accessibility is crucial, with desktops leading slightly.

Payment Preferences:

Google Pay & PayPal are the top payment methods (0.11M each), while Apple Pay & Credit Card contribute 0.08M each.

No purchases recorded under "None", which could indicate all customers use a registered payment method.

4. Customer Conversion & Drop-Off Analysis

Page Visited vs Purchased (Donut Chart):

84.07% (8K users) visited pages but did not purchase, while only 15.93% (2K) converted to buyers.

This suggests a high bounce rate, possibly due to checkout friction or lack of incentives.

Products Viewed vs Added to Cart:

A large difference between viewed and added-to-cart products, indicating customer hesitation or lack of purchase motivation.

Possible reasons: pricing, trust issues, unclear product details, or competitive alternatives.

Business Recommendations

1. Enhance Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

Simplify checkout processes and offer guest checkout options.

Provide incentives (discounts, free shipping) for first-time customers.

Improve product descriptions and reviews to increase customer confidence.

2. Device-Specific Optimization

Mobile experience should be enhanced, as it lags behind in sales despite high engagement.

Optimize UI/UX across desktop, tablet, and mobile for seamless navigation.

3. Targeted Marketing Based on Geography

Focus marketing campaigns on high-sales regions and identify underperforming areas for improvement.

Implement regional discounts or offers to boost engagement in lower-sales locations.

4. Boost Customer Retention & Loyalty

Introduce loyalty programs to encourage repeat purchases.

Implement retargeting ads for users who visited but didnâ€™t purchase.

5. Analyze Payment Preferences Further

Google Pay & PayPal dominate, but lower adoption of Apple Pay & Credit Cards suggests room for expansion.

Consider adding more local payment options for international customers.

Conclusion

This Power BI dashboard effectively visualizes customer behavior and sales insights, helping businesses optimize marketing strategies, improve conversion rates, and enhance user experience. By addressing conversion bottlenecks, regional sales variations, and device-specific behaviors, businesses can drive more revenue and customer satisfaction.

This analysis helps identify key customer behaviors, optimize marketing efforts, and enhance business decision-making for e-commerce platforms.
